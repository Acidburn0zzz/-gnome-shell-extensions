GNOME Shell Extensions is a collection of extensions providing additional
and optional functionality to GNOME Shell.
Since GNOME Shell is not API stable, extensions work only against a very
specific version of the shell, usually the same as this package (see
"configure --version"). Also, since extensions are built from many
individual contributors, we cannot guarantee stability or quality for any
specific extension.
For these reasons, distributions are advised to avoid installing or packaging
this module by defaul.
